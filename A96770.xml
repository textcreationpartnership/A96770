            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The 2 HouÅ¿es in a full and free Parliament took into conÅ¿ideration how to eaÅ¿e the people of their Taxes; in order whereto they ordained the Disbanding this Army (6000 or 7000 onely excepted to Å¿uppreÅ¿Å¿e InÅ¿urrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in <hi>England,</hi> and the reÅ¿t to be Å¿ent to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of <hi>Ireland</hi>) 200000<abbr>l.</abbr> was provided for this worke, for the reÅ¿t of their Arreares they were to have unqueÅ¿tionable Å¿ecurity. Lieutenant Generall <hi>Cromwell</hi> Å¿ubtilly encouraged the HouÅ¿e of Commons to this reÅ¿olution, with intent rather to diÅ¿content, then disband the Army (which hates nothing more then diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding, and returning to their old Trades) and then to make uÅ¿e of their diÅ¿contents againÅ¿t the Authours of this counÅ¿ell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men of different principles and intereÅ¿ts from himÅ¿elf.</p>
            <p>To carry on which deÅ¿igne, he, and his Son <hi>Ireton</hi> upon the 4 &amp; 5 of <hi>June,</hi> by their <hi>Agitators,</hi> (men whoÅ¿e publique Å¿pirits they abuÅ¿ed for private ends,<note place="margin">Book of Decl. p. 22.

            <p>In farther proÅ¿ecution of which deÅ¿igne, to pull downe their oppoÅ¿ite Faction: They cauÅ¿ed an <hi>Impeachment</hi> in the name of Sir <hi>Tho: Fairfax</hi> and the <hi>Army,</hi>

            <p n="2">2. They courted the people by <hi>undertaking to Å¿ettle Peace, to eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h the Kings intereÅ¿t, and all other juÅ¿t intereÅ¿ts:</hi> and invited the People <hi>to make AddreÅ¿Å¿es to the Army by Petitions againÅ¿t their grievances:</hi> to which they gave AnÅ¿wer, That, <hi>This and This is the Å¿enÅ¿e of the Army:</hi>

               <hi>PROLEGOMENA,</hi> OR, Selected ObÅ¿ervations, explaining the generall drift of the <hi>RemonÅ¿trance;</hi> and therfore Å¿et apart by themÅ¿elves.</head>
            <p>MAjor <hi>White</hi> Å¿aid in the Councell of the Army at Putney, <hi>That Å¿hortly there Å¿hould be no viÅ¿ible Authority left in the Kingdome but the power of the Sword.</hi> Though this was then in deÅ¿igne, yet becauÅ¿e he vented it unÅ¿eaÅ¿onably, before it was ripe for practiÅ¿e, he was expelled the Army; but Å¿oon taken in again, they being unwilling to loÅ¿e a man of their owne principles.</p>
            <p>9. <hi>March.</hi> The Engagement of the fugitive Members [to live &amp; die with the Army] was Å¿ent from the Lords to be approved by the Commons. Whereupon, <hi>Derby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houÅ¿e Projects, p.</hi> 7. (written by an Officer of the Army) Å¿aith, <hi>This was done to trie the temper of the HouÅ¿e, and if they had not approved it, they reÅ¿olved to flie to their Arms and make a New Charge againÅ¿t their OppoÅ¿ers; for they acknowledge amongst themÅ¿elves, That they rule by Power onely, and that the HouÅ¿e of Commons is no longer theirs then they over-awe them; and that they feare the Criticall day will come, which will diÅ¿cover the Parliament to be no longer theirs, then while they have a force upon it.</hi>

            <p>ObÅ¿erve, that upon theÅ¿e grounds the preÅ¿ent deÅ¿igne of this <hi>RemonÅ¿trance</hi> is, To make a new Charge, and diÅ¿Å¿olve this Parliament, and to make a new Parliament meerly popular, without King, or Lords; conÅ¿iÅ¿ting on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a RepreÅ¿entative of the People, of their owne chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing; for, the Army acknowledgeth none but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves and their Faction, to be <hi>the People:</hi> all other men are but <hi>Amalekites, or the Å¿eed of the curÅ¿ed,</hi> to be rooted out, that themÅ¿elves <hi>the Å¿eed of the Godly, the Faithfull</hi> onely may inherit this good Land. And this New Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Å¿hall be accountable to the People, that is, to the Army. Compare the RemonÅ¿tr: and the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Army following it. So we Å¿hall be govern'd arbitrarily by a Popular Parliament protected and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled by a Å¿tanding Army: the Lawes (which depend wholly upon the Authority of the Crowne, for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, interpretation, and execution) being firÅ¿t plucked up by the roots: in the pulling downe of Monarchy, look about you EngliÅ¿hmen; you have fought for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Lawes, and Liberties, untill you are cheated of them all.</p>
